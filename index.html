<h3>What is LEAF?</h3>

<p>A secure, feature-rich, customizable embedded Linux network appliance for use in a variety of network topologies. Although it can be used in other ways; it's primarily used as a Internet gateway, router, firewall, and wireless access point.</p>
<p><strong>Project Goals:</strong> Create an inclusive environment where LEAF project members and the extended community are free to release content to the public. Support continued development of current LEAF releases/branches. Create new LEAF releases/branches with current Linux kernels and libraries, while retaining the option to install the target environment on various devices attached to the target. Maintain as small a footprint as possible for release/branch target installations. Promote creation of packages usable by all LEAF releases/branches.</p>
