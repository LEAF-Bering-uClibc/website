title: LEAF Bering-uClibc 4.0 is finally available
author: kapeka
---
After more than a year of development, three beta versions and one release candidate,the Bering-uClibc team releases the new major version Bering-uClibc 4.0. <p> The biggest changes from the 3.x versions are: </p> <p> <ul> <li>The Linux kernel is upgraded from 2.4.x to 2.6.x (current 4.0 version uses longterm 2.6.35 kernel branch).</li> <li>The Shorewall package is upgraded from 3.x to 4.x.</li>                                                                           <li>The uClibc library is upgraded from 0.9.28 to 0.9.30.</li> </ul> </p> <p> The main disadvantage is that the distribution is much larger which means it no longer has any chance of being hosted          on floppy disk media. The main advantages are:                                                                                 <ul> <li>Proper stateful connection tracking for IPv6 is only supported from kernel version 2.6.24 onwards.</li> <li>Fully supported MSI/MSI-X interrupts handling, also supported RPS/RFS - that makes LEAF useful for high-performance routers/BRAS.</li> <li>Kernel-mode PPTP server and client (accel-pptp) will highly improve performance of PPTP data transferring and reduce CPU load.</li> <li>Hardware-specific kernel module loading has been partially automated, resulting in less of a requirement to understand which combination of modules is required on a particular hardware platform.</li>                              <li>The upgraded version of Shorewall requires a full installation of the Perl interpreter. This makes it possible to run other services which require Perl.</li> </ul> </p>

As expected after a long beta cycle and one Bering-uClibc RC, the final version provides only a few bugfixes and finetuning.                                                       

<p>
The notable changes for Bering-uClibc 4.0 final are:                                                                          
<ul>
