The LEAF Bering-uClibc released today a maintenance release for latest stable version 4.3.  A new package has been added to support naming of interfaces (bbnameif) and a small fix when autoloading squid has been added.  In the release candidate for 4.3.1 we've also updated tor and dnsmasq, and iproute and ulogd has received important fixes.
