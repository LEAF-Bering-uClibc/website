LEAF Bering-uClibc 5.2-beta2 has been released on 08 March 2015.

The Bering-uClibc made LEAF Bering-uClibc 5.2-beta2 available today.

In addition to the package updates for 5.1.3 and upcoming 5.1.4-rc1, packages for openldap, pmacctd, wget and clamav has been updated.
The kernel has also been updated to 3.14.34, as well as the gcc compiler in the toolchain.

New packages in this release are tinc (another vpn daemon), which requires testing and firmware support for Realtek NIC r8169 
has been added (useful for PCEngines APU board).

Last but not least a tarball for the Raspberry Pi board is available again.
