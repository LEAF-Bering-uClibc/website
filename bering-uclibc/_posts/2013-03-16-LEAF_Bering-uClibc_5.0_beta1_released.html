title: LEAF Bering-uClibc 5.0 beta1 released
author: kapeka
---
After more than one year of developement the LEAF Bering-uClibc team announces the first beta version of LEAF Bering-uClibc 5.0. <p> Bering-uClibc 5.0 is basically Bering-uClibc 4.x brought up to date with the latest versions of the main software components. But the most important changes are: <ul>  <li>The Linux kernel is upgraded from 2.6.x to a recent long-term release (3.4.34)</li> <li>The uClibc library is upgraded from 0.9.30 to 0.9.32.</li> <li>The toolchain (formerly known as buildenv) has been reworked to support more processors. Currently only images for X86_64 images are provided, but as a proof-of-concept an arm-versatile based version can be build as well.</li> <li>Usage of the toolchain has been alleviated in various aspects.</li> </ul> </p>

We've enabled more busybox applets (applets ifenslave, vconfig, bunzip2, unlzma, lzma, modinfo,setserial, beep, chat, mpstat, pstree, watch, nohup) and enabled verbose help messages for busybox applets.
<p>
zram support has been added (See the Bering-uClibc 5.x User Guide "Configuring leaf.cfg" for more details).</p>
<p>Work on Bering-uClibc 5.x started in October 2011, with Andrew as the lead developer and contributions from kapeka, Erich Titl, davidMbrooke and Yves Blusseau among others.</p>
