title: LEAF Bering-uClibc 4.1
author: kapeka

The final release of Bering-uClibc 4.1 has no major changes compared to the relaese candidate.                                              The version number has been fixed and hotplug.sh has been added to initrd - we missed that for rc1.  The changes since 4.0 are slightly more impressive:   

<p>
4.1 provdies a kernel update and more than a dozen packages has been updated to latest upstream versions.                                  
</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                           
For the first time dhcpv6 is supported (you can choose between dhpcd and dibbler) and support for MODBUS has been added.                                                                                                                     
</p>                                                                                                                                
<p>
About 6 Trac tickets has been closed, plus a few other mostly minor fixes.                                                                                                                               </p>
<p>
Also a history has been added to the shell, also a more capable mail system, and finally initrd can be rebuild on a LEAF router, to get rid of unnecessary modules or to add new ones to the boot environment (though this process is (yet?) not automated).
</p>
<p>
Under the hood the build environment has received updates to keep it working on current distributions and to alleviate the work on packages.
