title: Bering-uClibc 4.0-beta1 released

Bering-uClibc 4.0-beta has been released today. LEAF Bering-uClibc is basically Bering-uClibc 3.x brought up to date with the latest versions of the main software components. The most important changes are:  <ul> <li>The Linux kernel is upgraded from 2.4.x to 2.6.x.</li> <li>The uClibc library is upgraded from 0.9.28 to 0.9.30.</li> <li>Upgrade of shorewall to the perl-based current version incl. shorewall6.</li> </ul>

These changes bring both advantages and disadvantages compared to
Bering-uClibc 3.x. The main disadvantage is that the distribution is much larger which means it no longer has any chance of being hosted on floppy disk media. The main advantages are: 

<ul>
<li>Proper stateful connection tracking for IPv6 is only supported from
  kernel version 2.6.24 onwards.</li>
<li>Hardware-specific kernel module loading has been partially automated, resulting in less of a requirement to understand which combination of modules is required on a particular hardware platform.</li>
<li>The upgraded version of Shorewall requires a full installation of the Perl interpreter. This makes it possible to run other services which require Perl.</li>
</ul>
